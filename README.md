This repository contains two directories `code` and `data`, which include the R codes and data txt files used for analyzing and plotting H2 oxidation rates and microbial data associated with Reji et al., 2025; "Moisture Controls on Hydrogen Oxidizing Bacteria: Implications for the Global Soil Hydrogen Sink"

- `H2_uptakeRates.final.Rmd`: R markdown file for generating plots of H2 uptake rates
- `H2_metagenome_plots.Rmd`: R markdown file with code analyzing metagenome, metatranscriptome, and MAG data presented in the manuscript.
- `fitting_models_updated.Rmd`: R markdown file for fitting H2 uptake models.

Eah .Rmd file in the `code` includes descriptions of the corresponding data files, which can be found in the `data` directory.
